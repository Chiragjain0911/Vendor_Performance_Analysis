# Vendor_Performance_Analysis

1. Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze vendor performance in order to improve profitability, efficiency, and decision-making in retail and wholesale operations.


2. Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency.

The goal of this analysis is to:

* Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.

* Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.

* Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.

* Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.

* Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.


3. Approach & Methodology
Step 1: Data Preparation (SQL)

* Explored and merged data from multiple database tables.

* Created a single aggregated table for analysis.

* Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Step 2: Analysis (Python â€“ Google Colab)

* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

* Conducted data cleaning and handled missing values.

* Answered key research questions about sales, profit margins, and vendor efficiency.



Step 3: Visualization & Dashboard (Power BI)

* Built a Power BI dashboard to make insights interactive and easy to understand.

Key visuals included:

* Total Sales, Purchases, Gross Profit, Profit Margin

* Top Vendors by Sales

* Low Performing Vendors (stock turnover)

* Vendor-specific insights



Step 4: Reporting

Summarized findings in a business-focused report for stakeholders.
